  Network Graph 1 from Assignment 3 shows us the relationship of user's between which user replied to whom.
  It is a undirected graph, whereever majority of clustering of nodes and edges occurs, it seems that in that particular region the user has replied a lot to other     user. I think there might also be some sort of bot replying to other user in dense regions.
  
 NetworkGraph 2 from Assignment 4 shows us a relationship between user's who have tetweeted each other. 
 The node represent the user's.Edges represent the relationship between one-to-one or many-to-many users.
 The graph to me seems normal, there seem's to be no bot replying large number of tweets, as data set is fairly distributed.
